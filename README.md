# Hi, the name's Jonas! 👋
### Web artisan. PC enthusiast. Night owl.
I passionately build awesome and modern web experiences

---

### And I achieve that by...
- 🗂 Clearly organizing my projects
- 💡 Finding the perfect variable names
- 💻 Making my code readable

### But sometimes...
- 🖌 I spend too much standardizing design systems
- 🤔 I worry too much about performance
-  ~Things are off by a pixel~ ✅ Nevermind, fixed that

### Also, I'm curious about...
- 🔒 Security in web applications
- 🚀 Performance optimization
- 👀 The future of frontend development (looking at you, Svelte)

---

### Oh, you might find interesting, that...
- 👍 I'm always glad to be of help (that might be the most useful fact on this list)
- 👾 I know all Pokemon by name (my memory amazes me sometimes)
- 🦉 Owls and wolves are the best animals (objectively, that is _of course_ 😉)
